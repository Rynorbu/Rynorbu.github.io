#### What I learned 
On February 20th, we had a flipped class where we focused on learning how to model an entity-relationship model. It was a lot of fun, and I'm excited to share what I learned during that time.

Working with my classmates was a fantastic experience for me. Before the practical session, I only had a theoretical understanding of ER models and their types, but while practically designing the model i learned alot about ER model on how they are represented and made me relate to the real life scenario.

In the process of designing the ER model for the Student Information Management System, I learned the importance of choosing a primary key and understanding the symbols for various components. It became clear to me that the primary key plays a crucial role, and I decided to use "Admin_id" as it was unique. I also made sure to underline it, emphasizing its significance in the ER model.

#### what I did
In our flipped class, we are splited into groups of 6 with 4 members each. My group worked on designing a model for Student Information Management System. We were given 50 minutes to complete our task on designing a model for the Student Information Management System. 

I had fun time desingning the model. While creating the design, my mate and I learned alot from each other. We shared our ideas and helped each other and we managed to finish the task together within the given time. 

We presented our work to the entire class for 10 minutes, and our tutor made it engaging by asking questions about our databases. This really helped me understand the concept better.

#### How can flipped class be improved.
The flipped class idea is great for learning. I had so much fun and made me undertand more comared to theory calss, but it would be even better if our tutor could give us feedback on our presentations and having more resources to study would also be really helpful. This way, I could get guidance on how we did and have extra materials to learn more.
