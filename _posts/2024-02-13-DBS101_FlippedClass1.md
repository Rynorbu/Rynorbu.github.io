---
During the flipped class session of 1 hour 45 minutes we are given the task about the database administrator,  types of database user and roles and responsibilities of database administrator. During this period I have learned about the the types and roles of database administrator and user.

Here are some of my understandings during the flipped class;


### Types of Database User.

There are mainly eight types of database user, they are:

1. Database administrator(DBA): DBA create or organize systems to store and secure a variety of datas. It ensures that databases run efficiently.

2. Naive/ Parametric end-user: Are the user that use database applicationon in day to day life but they does not have any knowledge about the database management system(DBMS).They use the database application frequently to get the desired outcome. 

3. System Analyst: Are the ones that checks wheather they meet the needs and requirements of the user. They analyzes and assess the needs of the naive/ parametric end-user.

4. Sophisticated User: Are the user that are experienced, skilled and familar with the batabase. To satisfy thier own requirement they have the ability to develop thier own database application.

5. Database Designer: Are the ones who organizes the database so that the informations can easily be sorted and retrived.

6. Applications Programmers: Are also known as back-end developer. They are professionals or experties that creates and manages the database system.They are responsible for making the user interact with the database.

7. Casual user/ Temporary user: They are the type of database user who uses the database time to time or once in a while. They usually have little knowledge about the DBMS. Every time when they access the data, they need new infomation.

8. Specialized user: Are responsible for creating database and writing programe for database.


### Roles and Responsibilities of Database Administrator.

* Designing and planning: They plan on how the data should be organized, so that datas are stored efficiently and retrieve the data quickly.

* Data backup and recovery: To avoid the loss of data they make sure to save copies of the data.

* Technical support: They help the user and IT staff regarding any problem related to the database.

* Maintaining security: They make sure that the data is protected, keeping the data secure by maintaing data integrity.

### What we did during flipped class.

We started the class by dividing into 4 groups consisting of 6 memebers and given some amount of time to discuss on a given topic about the types of database user and roles of database administrator. After the discussion we form new group consiting of different member from the original group to explain what we have learned on a given topic. Then each group are given some questions about the given topics.

### Improvement neded in flipped class.

Giving opportunites to every students to talk about their own understanding about the topic can make them to remember for longer duration. Using real life examples to explain things so that it becomes make more practical and easier to understand.
