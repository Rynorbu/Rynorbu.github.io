Hello everyone, I hope you all are doing good! In this page we will be learning about the Dav challenges from Try Hack Me.

## Target IP Address

    10,.10..189.52

## Enumeration

### Ping

I pinged the target machine to check whether I can communicate with the target machine or not using the ping command and the target IP address.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/ping.png)

Yes, the machine is online and I can communicate with it.

Then, I scaned the target machine using Nmap to identify open ports and services.

### Nmap

I scanned the machine to see the open ports;

![alt text](../dav_ctf/nmap.png)

### result

* 80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

### Web 

This is what I got when I visited the target IP address in the browser.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/ip.png)

It is about default Apache website. 

Then I brute forced the directories using ffuf and found the following directories.

    rybnorbu@lenevo-ranjung:~/Downloads$ ffuf -w /home/rybnorbu/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.189.52//FUZZ

I found the webdav directory. When I visited the webdav directory I found the login page.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/ip_dav.png)

![alt text](../dav_ctf/webdav.png)

So, after some research I found that the default credentials for webdav is `wampp:xampp`. I referenced this from [here](https://xforeveryman.blogspot.com/2012/01/helper-webdav-xampp-173-default.html).

![alt text](../dav_ctf/web.png)

I logged in with this credentials and found the site.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/found.png)

Inside the passwd.dav. I found this:

    wampp:$apr1$Wm2VTkFL$PVNRQv7kzqXQIHe14qKA91

I used hash-identifier to identify the hash type.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/hash_id.png)

I tried to crack the hash but failed. I used hashcat to crack the hash.

    rybnorbu@lenevo-ranjung:~/Desktop/Hacking/hashCrask$ hashcat -m 1600 -a 0 hash_dav.txt rockyou.txt

This is the output of the hashcat.

I found a resource that teach to upload a shell using `cadaver`. I used this tool cadaver to upload a reverse shell.

This is how to use cadaver to upload a shell.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/put.png)

Same like this first I logged into the site inside the terminal and then uploaded the shell. The shell I used is `r_shell.php`. I uploaded the shell in the webdav directory.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/rshell.png)

I have successfully uploaded the shell.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/rshell_uploaded.png)

Now, I started the listener in my machine and visited the shell in the browser.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/userfalg.png)

I have used a snippet of code to stabilize the shell. 

    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

This is the code I used to stabilize the shell. And I got the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation Phase

I checked the privileges of the user using the command `sudo -l`.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/privilage.png)

From this I got a hint that I can get the root access by running the command `sudo /bin/bash` without password. So, I ran the command `sudo /bin/bash` and got the root access. I used cat as root without password.

![alt text](../dav_ctf/rootflag.png)

Finally, I got the root flag.


    Thank You!!
