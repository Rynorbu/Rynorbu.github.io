Hello everyone, I hope you all are doing good! In this page we will be learning about the Ignite challenges from Try Hack Me.

## Target IP Address

    10.10.235.57

## Enumeration

First, I pinged the target machine to check whether I can communicate with the target machine or not using the ping command and the target IP address. The machine is up and running.

### Nmap

I have used nmap to scan the target IP address to see the open ports.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/namp.png)

### Result

* 80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

After that I have navigated to the web browser and visited the target IP address to see what is there. I found the following webpage.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/webpage.png)

Inside the webpage I found out that the machine is running Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.18 on Ubuntu and the Fuel CMS version 1.4.1 is running on the server. 

## Brute force

I have used ffuf to brute force the directories and found the following directories.

    rybnorbu@lenevo-ranjung:~/Downloads$ ffuf -w /home/rybnorbu/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.235.57//FUZZ

I have found many directories and files using ffuf. Let's navigate to the `/robots.txt.` directory and see what is there.

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /fuel/

Inside this directory I found out that the `/fuel/` directory is disallowed. Let's navigate to the `/fuel/` directory and see what is there.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/login.png)

It contains a login page for fuelcms. The login credentials are already given in the webpage, It's `admin:admin`

![alt text](<../ignite_ctf/password and username.png>)

I found this site when I logged in using this information.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/loggein.png)

I have used the searchsploit module to find the exploit code for Fuel CMS 1.4.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/searchsploit.png)

To download the python script I have used this command 

    searchsploit -m php/webapps/50477.py

I have downloade `50477.py` script.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/download.png)

After downloading the script I run the script.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/run.png)

I have found the flag.

## Privilage Escalation

I have used reverse shell to get the shell access to the target machine.

I have done a reverse shell by running a code that I copied from a cheetsheet `pentest monkey.` 

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/pentmonkey.png)

From another terminal I have started the netcat listener.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/ncat.png)

I was able to get the shell access to the target machine.

To get the root access I used `su root` command but it asked for the password. So, I found the password in the database.php file and is `mememe`.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/1.png)

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/rootpass.png)

Then I ran `su root` command and got root access.

![alt text](../ignite_ctf/rootflag.png)

I got the rootflag.
